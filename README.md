Animations
==========

A repository from my talk "Gratuitous Animations How Subtlety in User Experience Design can Impress Your Users and Apple"

Animations can make or break the user experience of a mobile app. It is important when building apps to remember that animations can be a powerfultool and can often do more for a user's experience than the interfaces they inhabit.

In the session I highlighted some great examples of three classes of animations from around the App Store, talk through their specific implementation, and even slow them down for a frame by frame analysis:

- Informative Animations (helping the user better understand the app they are using)
- Welcoming Animations (setting the stage for a great app experience)
- Delightful Animations (animations that go the extra mile for the hell of it)

Finally, I concluded with specific recommendations on how to take advantage of these types of animations.

## Code 

These code examples are a re-implementation of a few screens from Glassboard for iOS. As such there are assets that aren't properly configured or added to the project and a coding style I wouldn't typically use. 
Also keep in mind this *doesn't work on th 3.5 inch simulator and only the 4*.
